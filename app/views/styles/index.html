      <h1 class="heading-section">Styles</h1>

      <p>Digital services for government staff users in the Home Office (new services and existing digital services that are being redeveloped) should use these styles.</p>
      <p>In the Home Office this includes:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>caseworking systems</li>
        <li>microsites</li>
        <li>intranets</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The styles are available in a <a href="https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/ho-style-prototype-kit">Home Office version of the prototype kit</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why we created these styles</h2>
      <p>If your service is not on a gov.uk or service.gov.uk domain, you cannot use the GOV.UK crown logo (Service Manual, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/services-for-government-users">Services for government users</a>) or the <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/11/can-i-use-the-gov-uk-fonts/">GDS Transport font</a>.</p>
      <p>Most Home Office services for government staff users fall within these restrictions. For those services, these styles replace the GOV.UK styling.</p>
      <p>This guidance applies to digital services, and does not affect or change any of the Home Office’s existing brand advice for print and offline applications.</p>
