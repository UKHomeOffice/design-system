      <p>The Home Office follows the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/">GOV.UK Design System contribution criteria.</a> The only difference is that contributions will be reviewed by the Home Office’s Design System Working Group.</p>

      <p>The contents of the Design System must be of a high quality and meet user needs. To guarantee this, all components and patterns need to meet certain criteria.</p>

      <h2>New proposals</h2>
      <p>To be successful, proposals need to show that the component or pattern being suggested would be useful and unique.</p>

      <p>The <a href="/get-involved/working/">Design System Working Group</a> reviews proposals in the <a href="/get-involved/backlog/">community backlog</a> to check they meet these criteria. Proposals that meet the criteria will then be marked ‘to do’, ready to be worked on.</p>
