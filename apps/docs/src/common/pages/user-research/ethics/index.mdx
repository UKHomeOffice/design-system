Ethical research and consent  
As a government department, we have a duty to protect the dignity, privacy and safety of our research participants and our user researchers.  

Ethical research involves:  

Transparency and informed consent  
We get informed consent from everyone who takes part in research, whether itâ€™s online, paper or verbal. This includes external participants (service users), internal participants (Home Office staff), and other professionals who work with the Home Office to deliver public services.  

We are fully transparent with our users when they take part in our research. This means that we explain everything that is involved in the research and what we need from them.  

Privacy, confidentiality and data protection 
All of our user researchers are fully trained on privacy, confidentiality and data protection. If you are a user researcher and want to learn more about the training we offer, take a look at our UCD community hub on the Home Office intranet.  

Vulnerable participants / risks to user researchers  
If you are a user researcher and you will be involving vulnerable participants in your research or if there is a risk to you, you must make a submission to our internal ethics board. That page contains information on how we describe vulnerable participants and what constitutes as a risk to a researcher.
