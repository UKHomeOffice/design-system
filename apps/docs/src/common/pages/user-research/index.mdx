## User research is essential for user centred design (UCD).  

User research helps us to design and build a service that works well for all of our users. This includes disabled people, people who do not speak English as their first language and people with lower digital literacy.  

Before we start work on a new project, we always try to understand our users and their journey through our services through research. We usually have at least one user researcher in a service team to help us with this.  

As a user researcher, you will: 

- help your team to learn about the people that use our services 
- plan and run research activities with users  
- use a range of research methods including interviews, **observations** and usability testing to build a picture of usersâ€™ environments, needs and contexts of use 
- analyse research findings to produce actionable insights, which enables an evidence-based approach and reduces risks to delivery
