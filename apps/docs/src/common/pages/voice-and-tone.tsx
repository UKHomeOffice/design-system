<h1><span class="caption">Content style guide</span>Voice and tone</h1>  

<h2>Home Office voice</h2> 

<p class=”govuk-body”>Our voice should be consistent across all our products and services. It is who we are and how we want others to see us.</p> 

<p class=”govuk-body”>Our voice should reflect our core Home Office values: compassionate, courageous, respectful and collaborative.</p> 

<p class=”govuk-body”>For our content, this means we want to speak to people in a way that is:</p> 

<ul class=”govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"> 

<li>human</li>  

<li>empowering</li> 

<li>respectful</li> 

<li>clear</li> 

</ul> 

<p class=”govuk-body”>What this means:</p> 

<ul class=”govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"> 

<li>Being <strong>human</strong> means using the words our readers understand, being empathetic, and not being monotonous or formulaic. It is varied in structure. It is not matey or over familiar.</li>  

<li><strong>Empowering</strong> language focuses on what you can do instead of what you cannot do, or what will be done to you. Speak to the reader. Write in the active voice and use ‘you’ where you can. Provide next steps.</li> 

<li>A <strong>respectful</strong> voice is inclusive, considerate, sensitive, and neutral. It fosters an environment where all perspectives are valued and treated with dignity. It is not accusing or demanding.</li> 

<li><strong>Clear</strong> language is unambiguous, precise, active, and decisive. It is transparent, honest about what we are doing and why, and clarifies and explains. It does not hide meaning behind legal or government jargon. A clear voice presents us as confident, trustworthy and organised.</li> 

</ul> 


<h2>Tone</h2> 

<p class=”govuk-body”>The tone of our content will vary depending on user need and channel. Like in conversation, this is about us being responsive to the person and their context.</p> 

<p class=”govuk-body”>Here are some examples:</p> 

<ul class=”govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"> 

<li>The tone of our ‘Ask Metis’ HR virtual assistant is ‘conversational, informal, and varied’ to reflect the conversational nature of the interaction.</li> 

<li>Our Home Office case management systems should have a direct, clear and active tone. Staff need instructional and straightforward language that reflects their work processes so they can quickly and accurately complete tasks and make decisions on often sensitive cases. We avoid using a tone that could be offensive, flippant or inappropriate.</li> 

</ul>
