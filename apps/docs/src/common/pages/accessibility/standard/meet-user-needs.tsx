    <p>When doing user research, make sure to include users with disabilities (at least 1 out of every 5 participants).</p>
    <h4>Implementation guidance</h4>
    <p>During user research activity, at least 1 in 5 participants must have a disability. You should ensure that you include a diverse group of disabled users with a range of disabilities that represents the population you’re researching.</p>
    <h4>How to test</h4>
    <p>You should ensure that you work with the Research Operations team to identify and recruit disabled participants. You should use appropriate research methods as defined by the Head of User Research.</p>
