    <h2>Helping everyone</h2>
    <p>All users benefit from clear, visible notification messages which are presented in a consistent, predictable way.</p>
    <p>Notification messages are especially important for screen reader users who may not be able to perceive the information visually.</p>

    <h2>The basics</h2>
      <p>Do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>use <A href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions">ARIA live regions</A> to communicate status messages or updates to screen reader users</li>
        <li>use the polite setting (see more under ‘Announcements’) to avoid interrupting other screen reader announcements</li>
        <li>keep visual and keyboard focus in the same place on the page</li>
        <li>give people enough time to read the notification message</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Do not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>use visually intrusive notifications</li>
        <li>overuse alerts in a way that causes frequent interruptions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Creating good notifications</h2>
      <p>Notification messages do not typically ask a user to do something. If user interaction is needed you would most typically do this using a <A href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/30">modal dialogue</A>.</p>

      <h3>Announcement</h3>
      <p>Notification should give general information and update users. Status messages or updates which occur visually should also be communicated to screen reader users.</p>
      <p>Notification and status messages should be implemented using an <A href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions">ARIA live region</A>. Only screen reader users will  benefit from ARIA live regions.</p>
      <p>Use the polite setting, which prompts the screen reader to announce the change when the user is idle to avoid interrupting them. Avoid using the assertive setting for ARIA live regions unless this is communicating something time-sensitive or critical.</p>
      <p>Setting role="status" aria-live="polite" ensures compatibility across browsers.</p>
      <code>&lt;div id="notification" role="status" aria-live="polite"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>
      <p>Use a script to insert text into the live region to notify a screen reader.</p>
      <p>See <A href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/working-examples/aria-role-status-searchresults/">Using role=status to Provide Status Message on Search Results</A> and <A href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/working-examples/aria-role-status-shoppingcart/">Using role=status to Provide Status Message on Shopping Cart</A> for working examples on how to implement role="status".</p>
      <p>Where a notification is  visual rather than textual, provide some visually hidden text describing the interface response. If success is communicated via a green tick for example, provide that response as visually hidden text.</p>

      <h3>Appearance</h3>
      <p>Notifications should be non-intrusive and only used when there is a benefit to the user, for instance informing them how many search results have been returned, that errors have occurred in their submission, or that a form has been successfully submitted.</p>
      <p>Ensure that notifications are visible for long enough to allow people to successfully locate and read the message. See <A href="https://sheribyrnehaber.medium.com/designing-toast-messages-for-accessibility-fb610ac364be">Designing Toast Messages for Accessibility</A> for a calculation of the minimum amount of time that these should be displayed. Ensure that notification messages are located in a consistent location and that these do not overlap critical content.</p>
      <p>The message should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. See our <A href="/accessibility/readability">readability guidance</A> for information on how to make your language easier to understand.</p>
      <p>Ensure that text and icons have sufficient colour contrast and that meaning is not conveyed by colour alone. See our <A href="/accessibility/colour-and-contrast">colour and contrast guidance</A> for information on how to ensure that text meets minimum contrast requirements.</p>
      <p>Notification text should respond to user adjustments such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>resizing up to 400%</li>
        <li>changing style properties, for example line height and letter spacing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Limit the number of notifications to reduce visual distraction, as well as auditory distraction from screen reader announcements and any notification sounds.</p>

      <h3>Interactivity</h3>
      <p>Where notifications do not close automatically, present a way to close them using either the ESC key or using a dedicated close button.</p>

      <h3>Focus</h3>
      <p>Where possible, avoid moving the visual or keyboard focus.</p>
