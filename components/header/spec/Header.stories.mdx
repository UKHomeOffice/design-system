# Header

The Home Office header shows users that they are on an internal Home Office service and indicates which service they are using.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Header">
    <Header serviceName="Service name" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={ Header } />

## When to use this component
You must use the Home Office header if your service:
- is internal, such as a caseworking system or admin service, and
- sits on a homeoffice.gov.uk domain

## When not to use this component
You must not use the Home Office header if your service:
- is public-facing and transactional, and
- sits on a gov.uk or service.gov.uk domain
