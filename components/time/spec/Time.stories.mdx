## When to use this component

This component is a standard code implementation for displaying easy to read times to users from:

- a time such as 22:37
- [ISO format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) such as 2022-07-21T22:37:34.570Z

## How to use this component
### 12-hour

Display the time in the 12 hour clock.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Standard">
	<Time
	  time="22:37"
	/>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### 24-hour
You should use the 12-hour clock. For example, 5:30pm and 2:30am.

If you have evidence that your internal users regularly use the 24-hour and find it easier, then you may choose to use the 24-hour clock to display time. For example, 17:30 and 02:30. We need more evidence and research to validate this.

<Preview>
  <Story name="24 Hour">
	<Time
	  time="22:37"
	  clockType={24}
	/>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### ISO format date-time input

You can provide a [full ISO formatted date-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)) and display just the time as calculated from the timezone.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Date-time">
	  <Time
	    time="2022-07-21T22:37:34.570Z"
	  />
  </Story>
</Preview>
