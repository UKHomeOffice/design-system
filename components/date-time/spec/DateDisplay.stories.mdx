# Display a date

Displays dates to users within services

## When to use this component

This is a standard code implementation to display a date. Use this to display a date in the format:

- 4 January 2014

Follow the [date GOV.UK style guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#dates) to decide which format to use within your service.

Do not use if you are displaying a time as well, instead use [display a time](components?name=Time%20display).

## How it works
Use this component to display a date in a standard format.

<Preview withToolbar>
	<Story name="Standard date">
		<DateTime ISOString={"2022-01-16T15:30:00.000Z"} displayDate={true} />
	</Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={DateTime} />

Multiple Home Office services present dates to users. For example, a date is used to:

- orient users in cases where date has significance - for example, when staff are reviewing actions relating to a specific date, the date is used as a heading
- offer users information which they need to check or confirm
