# Display a date and time

Display dates and times to users within services.

## When to use this component

This component offers a standard code implementation for displaying a dates and times to users. Use this when the date and time need to be used together.

Follow the [time GOV.UK style guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#times) and the [GOV.UK date guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#dates) to decide which format to use within your service.

Do not use if you are only:

- displaying a date, instead use [display a date](components?name=Date%20display)
- displaying a time, instead use [display a time](components?name=Time%20display)

## How it works
Use this component to display dates and times in a standard format.

<Preview withToolbar>
	<Story name="Date with time after">
		<DateTime
			ISOString={"2022-01-16T15:30:00.000Z"}
			displayTime={true}
			displayDate={true}
			precedence={"date"}
			clockType={12}
		/>
	</Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={DateTime} />

### Time format

You should use the 12-hour clock. For example, 5:30pm and 2:30am.

If you have evidence that your users regularly use the 24-hour and find it easier, then you may choose to use the 24-hour clock to display time. For example, 17:30 and 02:30.

For services used by internal users, you may choose to use the 24-hour clock. For example, 17:30 and 02:30. We need more evidence and research to validate this.

<Preview>
	<Story name="Date with 24-hour time after">
		<DateTime
			ISOString={"2022-01-16T15:30:00.000Z"}
			displayTime={true}
			displayDate={true}
			precedence={"date"}
			clockType={24}
		/>
	</Story>
</Preview>

### Order of date and time

You should use evidence to assess whether the date or the time is most important to your users.

If the time is more important, change the order so that the time comes before the date.

<Preview>
	<Story name="Time with date after">
		<DateTime
			ISOString={"2022-01-16T15:30:00.000Z"}
			displayTime={true}
			displayDate={true}
			precedence={"time"}
			clockType={12}
		/>
	</Story>
</Preview>

## Contribute

This component needs improving. We need evidence about:

- when to use the 24-hour clock
- displaying time zones
- when to display the date before the time, or the time before the date
