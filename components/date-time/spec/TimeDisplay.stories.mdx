# Display a time

Display times to users within services

## When to use this component

This is a standard code implementation to display a time. Use this to display a time such as:

- 5:32pm
- 10:27am

Do not use if you are displaying a date as well, instead use [display date and time](components?name=Date%20and%20time%20display).

## How it works
Use this component to display a time in a standard format.

<Preview withToolbar>
	<Story name="Standard 12 hour time">
		<DateTime
			ISOString={"2022-01-16T15:30:00.000Z"}
			displayTime={true}
			clockType={12}
		/>
	</Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={DateTime} />

Follow the [time GOV.UK style guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#times) to decide which format to use within your service.

You should use the 12-hour clock. For example, 5:30pm and 2:30am.

If you have evidence that your users regularly use the 24-hour and find it easier, then you may choose to use the 24-hour clock to display time. For example, 17:30 and 02:30.

For services used by internal users, you may choose to use the 24-hour clock. For example, 17:30 and 02:30. We need more evidence and research to validate this.

<Preview>
	<Story name="Standard 24 hour time">
		<DateTime
			ISOString={"2022-01-16T15:30:00.000Z"}
			displayTime={true}
			clockType={24}
		/>
	</Story>
</Preview>

## Contribute

This component needs improving. We need evidence about:

- when to use the 24-hour clock
- displaying time zones
