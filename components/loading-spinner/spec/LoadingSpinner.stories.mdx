# Loading spinner

Tell a user they need to wait, because something is happening.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Custom Text">
    <LoadingSpinner>Loading the next task for this case</LoadingSpinner>
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={ LoadingSpinner } />

## When to use this component
Use a loading spinner to inform users they need to wait for something to happen. For example, you can use a loading spinner to show that a result is taking time to process.
 
Consider whether the speed and responsiveness of the service can be technically improved before using a loading spinner.

## How it works

<Preview>
  <Story name="Default Text">
    <LoadingSpinner />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### If something goes wrong
If something goes wrong or the loading period times out, tell users there has been a problem and provide a link to another suitable action. Do not allow the loading spinner to loop indefinitely. 

## Writing for this component
Explain what the user is waiting for.

The explanation is a heading 1, so do not show another heading 1 with the loading spinner.

## Accessibility

If you do need a loading screen, ensure that: 
- you agree a maximum loading time that is suitable for the action 
- content clearly describes what the user is waiting for

To help assistive technology users, ensure your code includes: 
- aria-live=”polite” 
- role=”status” 
- the div is called “loading”

This component only uses HTML and css - it does not use javascript. It does not require users to have javascript enabled.

## Research

The loading spinner is used by:
- Atlas caseworking system
- Manage appointment booking
- Generic ID verification web

Another department found that using an animated loading spinner gave users more confidence that something is still happening, over a static message.

## Help improve this component

This component needs improving. We need evidence about:
- further accessibility considerations
- using the loading spinner for part of a page
