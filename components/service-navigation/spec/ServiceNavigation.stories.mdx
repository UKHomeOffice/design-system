# Service navigation

Service navigation helps users understand that they’re using your service and lets them navigate around your service.

We alter the styling from the GOV.UK Design System component to better suit the rest of our page design.

Read the [Service navigation guidance on the GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/service-navigation/).
