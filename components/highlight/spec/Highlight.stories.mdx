## Writing for this component
Consider explaining the purpose of the highlight, especially if there are different use cases within a service. It takes users time to work out what the highlight is showing.

## Accessibility

You should:
* combine bold text with the highlight
* use in moderation - overuse reduces efficacy and can cause unecessary mental load, especially for people using screen readers

## Research

This component is used by:
* an internal service to compare identity details

The highlight does not work if:
* it's overused
* there are multiple conflicting colours on the screen

We found this from usability testing with 3 external participants with access needs, with varying severities of vision loss. Participants used screen readers and zoom function whilst participating. High level findings include:
* the highlight doesnâ€™t draw the attention of users using screen readers
* bold was more useful to alert participants who were partially sighted
* conflicting colours on screen was disorienting for partially sighted users

## Help us improve this component

This component needs improving. We need more evidence about:
* internal staff, who use systems daily
* users with other access needs, such as dyslexia, dyscalculia and ADHD
* new staff members or those recently trained on a service
