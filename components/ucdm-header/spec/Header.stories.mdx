# Header

The Home Office header shows users that they are on an internal Home Office service and indicates which service they are using.

For now, this version is just for use on the User-Centred Design Manual.

  <Story name="Header">
    <Header serviceName="Service name" />
  </Story>

<Props of={ Header } />

## When to use this component
You must use the Home Office header if your service:
- is internal, such as a caseworking system or admin service, and
- sits on a homeoffice.gov.uk domain

## When not to use this component
You must not use the Home Office header if your service:
- is public-facing and transactional, and
- sits on a gov.uk or service.gov.uk domain
