## When to use this component

This component is a standard code implementation for displaying easy to read dates to users from:

- a date such as 2022-07-20
- [ISO format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) such as 2022-07-21T22:37:34.570Z

Follow the [GOV.UK date guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#dates) to decide which format to use within your service.

## How it works
### Standard

<Preview>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <DateDisplay date="2022-07-20" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### ISO format date-time input
You can provide a [full ISO formatted date-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)) and display just the time as calculated from the timezone.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Date-time">
    <DateDisplay date="2022-07-21T23:37:34.570Z" />
