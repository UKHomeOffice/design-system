      <p>The header inspires trust with the department logo, while the service name helps users understand which service they are using.</p>
      <p>The footer includes information about the department with relevant links. White background helps to clearly section the main content area.</p>

## How it works
### Standard page

<Preview>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <Page>
      <h1>Default page template</h1>
      <p>The header inspires trust with the department logo, while the service name helps users understand which service they are using.</p>
      <p>The footer includes information about the department with relevant links. White background helps to clearly section the main content area.</p>
    </Page>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Page with navigation links in the header and footer

<Preview>
  <Story name="Navigation">
    <Page
      accountHref="#/my-account"
      serviceName="Service name"
      signOutHref="#/auth/sign-out"
      username="User name"
      navigation={[
        { href: '/styles', text: 'Styles' },
        { href: '/components', text: 'Components' },
        { href: '/patterns', text: 'Patterns' },
        { href: '/resources', text: 'Resources' },
        { href: '/get-involved', text: 'Get involved' }
      ]}
      footerNavigation={[
        { href: '/feedback', text: 'Feedback' },
        { href: '/help', text: 'Help' },
        { href: 'https://gov.uk/', text: 'Gov.UK home' }
      ]}

## Accessibility

If your service uses this component, let us know of any insights you have on accessibility considerations.

## Research

Page is used by:

- Atlas caseworking system
- Central Operations Platform

Research has shown that a [grey background tint](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/styles/colour) behind areas of text reduces eye strain, particularly for services intended for regular and prolonged use.

Testing on our caseworking system called Atlas showed that:

- black text on a stark white background caused the words to 'dance' for dyslexic users and adding a shaded background stopped this from happening
- people who work night shifts and spend prolonged time on screens complained that stark white screens contributed to eye strain and made it difficult to concentrate

This is supported by advice in the [British Dyslexia Association style guide](https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/advice/employers/creating-a-dyslexia-friendly-workplace/dyslexia-friendly-style-guide), which recommends use of dark text on a light (not white) background.

While it's best practice to give users control over exactly how they see things (for example a peach overlay makes reading easier for many dyslexic users), adding a shaded background has benefits for a range of users.

We also know that some of our users work on shared computers, or computers which cannot be adapted to change the colour of the screen â€“ for example, border agents and prison guards.

## Help improve this component

This component needs improving. We need evidence about:

- how to write for this component
- which services are using this component
