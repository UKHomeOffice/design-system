# Contributing to the Home Office Design System

This design system is for everyone. Its purpose is to extend the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) with work specific to the Home Office. Patterns or components that have a wider use will be contributed to the GOV.UK Design System so they can be used by delivery teams across government.

## How to contribute

The design system has an open [backlog](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/design-system/projects/1).

Anyone can propose, develop or contribute to new patterns and components, or improvements to existing ones. Follow the guidance on how to [make a suggestion](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/contribute)

Contributions first start as [discussions](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/design-system/discussions), then become [issues](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/issues) before becoming a [pull request](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/design-system/pulls).
