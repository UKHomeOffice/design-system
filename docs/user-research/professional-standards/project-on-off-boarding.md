Project on-boarding and off-boarding
====================================

# Onboarding onto a new project 
  
When you welcome a new user research colleague into your team, point them to this UCD onboarding list to help them settle in. 

## User researcher checklist 

-	complete the new starter access form
-	run through the UCD induction Trello board (if new to the Home Office – you can get access to this by completing the new starter access form)
-	complete the mandatory UCD induction training
-	learn about working patterns of the team (agile ceremonies, ways of working)  
-	find out about team roadmap and project priorities   
-	book 121s with your manager
-	get access to team Confluence / GitHub / Mural / [all the approved tools you need]( https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/user-research/professional-standards/approved-tools) 
-	join team Trello boards   
-	get access to team Slack channels and the wider UCD community Slack channels
  
## New portfolio checklist 

If your colleague isn’t new to the Home Office but has come from a different portfolio, the portfolio lead or line manager should provide the following, if available: 

-	portfolio induction  
-	portfolio org chart   
-	overview of all services within portfolio and key projects happening  
-	guidance on specialist terminology / acronyms used in project and portfolio  
-	guidance on where and how to document things
  
**Line managers should also:**
-	invite researcher to portfolio-wide show and tells, town hall meetings, etc  
-	introduce researcher to immediate colleagues and team  
-	pair researcher with an informal buddy from the same profession  
-	arrange mentoring, where appropriate
  
# Offboarding from a project 

If an employee is leaving the Home Office altogether, their line manager will need to arrange a session with security to formally offboard them.

## Portfolio lead or line manager checklist 

Managers must:  
-	remove researcher from all delivery team boards  
-	remove from private team Slack groups and channels  
-	remove from [any approved tools](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/user-research/professional-standards/approved-tools) and any project-specific SharePoint groups / folders   
-	[let UCD Operations know](ucdops@homeoffice.gov.uk) so we can update our records, remove them from our mailing list and, if relevant, remove them from any general Slack and SharePoint groups
  
## User researcher checklist 

Researchers must: 
-	transfer ownership of any assets such as surveys, etc to your colleagues in your team 
-	transfer edit access to any new researchers joining the team 
-	save everything in one place, and make sure they refer to it with their handover notes  
-	put together a map of the end-to-end journey, if possible. They’re great for quickly getting a bird’s-eye view of a service
