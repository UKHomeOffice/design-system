User research
=============

# User research 
User research is essential for user centred design (UCD). 

User research helps us to design and build a service that works well for all our users, including people who do not speak English as their first language and people with lower digital literacy. 

Before we start work on a new project, we always try to understand our users and their journey through our services through research. We usually have at least one user researcher in a service team to help us with this. 

**As a user researcher, you will:**
-	help your team to learn about the people that use our services
-	plan and run research activities with users 
-	use a range of research methods including interviews, observations and usability testing to build a picture of usersâ€™ environments, needs and contexts of use
-	analyse research findings to produce actionable insights, which enables an evidence-based approach and reduces risks to delivery
