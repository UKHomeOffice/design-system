Training
========


All new starters are expected to complete mandatory training, including the UCD Induction and ‘Introduction to Research Ethics’, the first module of the Ethics and Data Handling training. This is module 1 of the 4-part ethics training. Everyone must complete module 1, but user researchers and those conducting research should register for modules 2, 3 and 4.


Other useful UCD training include ‘Content Review’ 2i training for Content Designers and ‘Introduction to Accessibility’ which is recommended for all UCD colleagues. 


All training is available to book on the [UCD community hub on the staff intranet](https://homeofficegovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/UCDcommunityHub). 


Other informal learning resources include membership to O’Reilly, a learning platform which includes access to books and journals and well as various online training courses.  We have also created training catalogues, with recommended training and reading lists for each profession.
