User-centred design community
=============================


We have an active UCD community, in which we share knowledge and collaborate. 
<br>

We expect designers and researchers to take part by:
- attending regular meetings, such as monthly profession team meet ups and UCD quarterly events
- contributing ideas and sharing best practice, for instance on Slack
- taking part in design reviews and crits of each other's work
- joining recruitment and service assessment panels
- sharing work with other teams to enable consistency across services when using patterns and components (working in the open)
