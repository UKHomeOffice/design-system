Community events
================

We encourage all UCD community members to attend UCD meet ups that are relevant to their role, as they play a big part in their professional development.

UCD Ops organise the following events to support the UCD Community:
- UCD monthlies, an hourly session to hear from UCD projects across DDaT (on hold)
- UCD quarterly meet ups – a wider gathering for the whole UCD community, usually themed around a particular UCD topic

There are also smaller profession meet ups each month, which offer a safe space for sharing and critiquing work.

## UCD SkillShare Sessions

UCD Skillshare Sessions are new interactive learning events to upskill the UCD community and provide an opportunity for colleagues to share new skills and interests. They are short, informal sessions that are self-led and organised by the community. 

Sessions can be used for a variety of purposes, including: 
•	workshops and interactive sessions
•	presentations from internal or external teams, including playbacks from projects


Colleagues can learn more about all these events on our [UCD community hub on the staff intranet](https://homeofficegovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/UCDcommunityHub/SitePages/Staff-events.aspx?csf=1&web=1&share=EZxHcWb_DIdKoR2N0mkQVRIB8903sr6XJqsG7Gn7MGsR-w&e=rSivCt&CID=48fb3e32-ec4a-4c75-a2d2-ae9fea2f36a0).
