## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1][wcag-v2] AA standard,

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

-   Some code blocks cannot be ‘scrolled’ by keyboard users (fails WCAG guideline 2.1.1 Keyboard. We will fix this by January 2022) 

-   There is a missing `<caption>` element on the Components page for tables within the ‘Props’ click to reveal (fails WCAG guideline 1.3.1 Info and relationships. We will fix this by January 2022) 

-   Issue with (Edge 90, Chrome 91) and on mobile (Android 11/Chrome 91, iOS 13.7/Safari) - the footer content does not adjust correctly when the page is zoomed in to 400%, so you may need to scroll horizontally to see all the items. The main content also overlaps with the footer on IE 11 (fails WCAG  guideline 1.4.10 Reflow. We will fix this by January 2022) 

-   The site map is a long list and should be divided into sections reflecting the structure of the website (fails WCAG guideline 2.4.5: Multiple Ways. We will fix this by January 2022)
