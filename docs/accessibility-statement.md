and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1][wcag-v2] AA standard,
due to the non-compliances listed below.


## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

-   Code blocks cannot be ‘scrolled’ by keyboard users (fails WCAG guideline 2.1.1 Keyboard. We will fix this by January 2021) 

-   There is a missing `<caption>` element on the Components page for tables within the ‘Props’ click to reveal (fails WCAG guideline 1.3.1 Info and relationships. We will fix this by January 2021) 

-   Text size of code lines is smaller than other text on the pages ‘Starting a new prototype’ and ‘Building your prototype’ (fails WCAG guideline 4.1.1 Parsing. We will fix this by January 2021) 

-   When tabbing the navigation menu at the top, the focus is yellow but not underlined (fails WCAG guideline 2.4.7 Focus visible. We will fix this by January 2021) 

-   Issue with (Edge 90, Chrome 91) and on mobile (Android 11/Chrome 91, iOS 13.7/Safari) - the footer content does not adjust correctly when the page is zoomed in to 400%, so you may need to scroll horizontally to see all the items. The main content also overlaps with the footer on IE 11 (fails WCAG  guideline 1.4.10 Reflow. We will fix this by January 2021) 

-   The site map is a long list and should be divided into sections reflecting the structure of the website (fails WCAG  guideline 2.4.8 Location. We will fix this by January 2021) 

-   The image on Component - Header page has a code error and so may not be read out correctly by screen readers (fails WCAG guideline 1.4.5 Images of text. We will fix this by January 2021) 

-   Issue with JAWS 2019 on Edge Version 90.0.818.41 - when tabbing through links, visible headings from main page are announced before the link (fails WCAG guideline 2.4.9 Link purpose. We will fix this by January 2021)
