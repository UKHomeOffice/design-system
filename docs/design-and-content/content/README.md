Our content designers work within services and on content for websites such as our staff SharePoint intranet and GOV.UK.  

We expect our content designers to:

-	ensure that design is written and edited in line with [accessibility guidelines](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/accessibility) 
-	collaborate and share work with other content designers across the Home Office 
-	collaborate and work with other professions, including pair writing 
-	take part in design reviews, content crits, and 2i (2 eye) peer reviews 
-	use our agreed design tools including Mural
