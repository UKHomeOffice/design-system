Content design
==============

We have a thriving content community at the Home Office. 

Our content designers work within services, systems and write content for websites such as our staff SharePoint intranet and GOV.UK. 

We expect our content designers to: 

- work to our Home Office style guide and the GOV.UK style guide 
- ensure that design is written and edited in line with accessibility guidelines 
- collaborate and share work with other content designers across the Home Office
- collaborate and work with other professions, using activities such as pair writing
- take part in design reviews, content crits, and 2i (2 eye) peer reviews
- use our agreed design tools including Mural
