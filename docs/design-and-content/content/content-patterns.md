Content patterns
================

Content patterns are a repeatable piece of text or copy that can be used across services. 

Any of our content designers can:
 
- draft a new content pattern 
- suggest a new pattern for the content backlog 
- propose a content section for an existing Home Office design system pattern 

Content patterns can be:

•	task-based – such as asking the user to enter their phone number to confirm a security code sent to them by text 

•	written in a specific way – which is often due to legal or policy advice 

•	text that has been used before – such as text in forms on the GOV.UK website, or the username in an email that will be addressed to them

•	part of a common design component – like an address look up or an expiration alert when a user is completing a form on the GOV.UK website 

Access the patterns page for further details on the patterns we have in the Home Office.
