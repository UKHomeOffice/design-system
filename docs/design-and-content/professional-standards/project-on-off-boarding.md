Project on-boarding and off-boarding
====================================

When you welcome a new design colleague into your team, point them to this UCD onboarding list to help them settle in. 

## Designer checklist 

-	complete the [new starter access form](https://www.homeofficesurveys.homeoffice.gov.uk/s/3OJU4F/) to get access to relevant tools
-	run through the UCD induction Trello board (if new to the Home Office – you can get access to this by completing the new starter access form)
-	complete the mandatory UCD induction training
-	learn about working patterns of the team (agile ceremonies, ways of working)  
-	find out about team roadmap and project priorities   
-	book 121s with your manager
-	join team Trello boards   
-	get access to team Slack channels and the wider UCD community Slack channels  
-	get edit access to existing files from team 
-	share any design assets created (for instance in Figma, Heroku) with your team
  
## New portfolio checklist 

If your colleague isn’t new to the Home Office but has come from a different portfolio, the portfolio lead or line manager should provide the following, if available: 

-	portfolio induction  
-	portfolio org chart   
-	overview of all services within portfolio and key projects happening  
-	guidance on specialist terminology / acronyms used in project and portfolio  
-	guidance on where and how to document things
-	invite designer to portfolio-wide show and tells, town hall meetings, etc  
-	introduce designer to immediate colleagues and team  
-	pair designer with an informal buddy from the same profession  
-	arrange mentoring, where appropriate
  
# Offboarding from a project 
If an employee is leaving the Home Office altogether, their line manager will need to arrange a session with security to formally offboard them.

## Portfolio lead or line manager checklist 

Managers must:  

-	remove designer from all delivery team boards  
-	remove from private team Slack groups and channels  
-	remove from Confluence / Heroku / Mural / and any project-specific SharePoint groups / folders   
-	[let the UCD Operations team know](mailto:ucdops@homeoffice.gov.uk) that we can update our records, remove them from our mailing list and, if relevant, remove them from any general Slack and SharePoint groups and release their Sketch account
  
## Designer checklist 

Designers must: 

-	transfer ownership of any design assets to your colleagues in your team 
-	transfer edit access to any new designer joining the team 
-	transfer any GitHub repos to team members or team account that’s held on [UKHomeOffice](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice)
-	store Sketch and offline assets in authorised shared design areas - check with line manager or portfolio lead  
-	if relevant, include screenshots of the service at the time of review. Without screenshots, it can be very difficult later on to work out what was there  
-	keep a list of additional functionality or design ideas to explore further  
-	save everything in one place, and make sure they refer to it with their handover notes  
-	put together a map of the end-to-end journey, if possible. They’re great for quickly getting a bird’s-eye view of a service
