You must not download and install alternatives without approval. If you have any questions about other tools and software not listed, [contact UCD Operations](mailto:ucdops@homeoffice.gov.uk) (UCD Ops).

## Design tools 

You must use design tools in line with our [security principles](https://homeofficegovuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/UCDcommunityHub/Shared%20Documents/Guidance/Hardware%20and%20software?csf=1&web=1&e=n2LErO) and follow good information security practice.   

-	Mural - for journey mapping, online collaboration and visualising concepts

Mural is assured by the Data Protection Office and Home Office Cyber Security, but usage has some caveats. To read how to use it and gain access, [read the Mural confluence page.](https://collaboration.homeoffice.gov.uk/display/MUR/Mural+Home?searchId=JF5BHJTHW)

-	GitHub - for Git repos

Sign up with a work email account. Only make private repositories, unless you have specifically discussed making them open with your delivery team.
  
-	GOV.UK prototype kit - for making interaction prototypes  

[Download the kit yourself](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/install/getting-started) from GOV.UK. Use a fresh copy of the kit each time you make a prototype.

-	Home Office plugin – for internal Home Office services

[Download the plugin yourself](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/design-system/get-started/home-office-plugin)

-	Heroku - for hosting GOV.UK prototypes

Heroku is assured by the Data Protection Office and Home Office Cyber Security. Ask your delivery team to add you to any existing prototypes hosted on Heroku. Complete the [UCD Ops request form](https://www.homeofficesurveys.homeoffice.gov.uk/s/C45NQD/) to ask for a license for Heroku.

-	Sketch - for prototyping and creating concepts 
Complete the [UCD Ops request form](https://www.homeofficesurveys.homeoffice.gov.uk/s/C45NQD/) to ask for a license for Sketch.  

## Tools you can use in a limited way 

Slack and Trello are widely used but not fully assured. We should be using these tools in a limited, or cautious, way. You must not add any personal data to these tools, and you should not use them for OFFICIAL – SENSITIVE information either. 

It is ok to share OneDrive / SharePoint links on Slack without attaching the actual file. 

-	Figma – teams may use the limited free version of Figma, however it is unsupported

As it is a cloud based solution, some teams may not be able to use it for security reasons – in such cases you should use Sketch. Figma has been assured by the Data Protection Office and Home Office Cyber Security, but so far is only available as a paid account in the Enablers portfolio.
  
-	Slack - submit an IT Now request with digital or POISE email account. Your delivery team will add you to groups and channel
  
-	Trello – self sign up with your digital email account
  
## Tools you can’t use 

The tools that Home Office has explicitly not allowed include, but are not limited to: 

-	Google tools   
You must not use any Google accounts including Google Drive, Docs or Sheets to create work-related assets or store documentation

You may, however, create a Google account with your work email to access cross-government remote meetings.
 
-	Miro  
Teams are advised not to use Miro to create design assets – use Mural instead

## Processes for introducing new tools 

If you want to use a tool that isn’t mentioned above, please speak to [UCD Ops](mailto:ucdops@homeoffice.gov.uk) first. 

We can give you advice on the assurance process for introducing new tools. You should note that introducing a new tool will depend on budget approval and can take a while to be approved.
