Design and content
==================

# What is user-centred design (UCD) at the Home Office?
 
UCD is where we think about our users and their needs at every stage of a design process. We aim to create simple, clear and joined-up user experiences that help people achieve their goals.
 
At the Home Office (HO) we work in agile, multidisciplinary teams to achieve this. You can [read more about our design and content roles](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/design-and-content/professional-standards/designer-role-standard) on the designer role standard page.
 
We expect our design and content community to:
 
- advocate for UCD in HO services
- collaboratively create and improve [design patterns](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/design-system/patterns)
- build and support UCD in the HO
- share and develop design knowledge and skills
 
UCD is an approach, not a team. Designing for our users should be an approach that the whole delivery team takes. [Visit the HO careers website](https://careers.homeoffice.gov.uk/role/digital-data-and-technology/user-centred-design) to learn more about our UCD careers.
